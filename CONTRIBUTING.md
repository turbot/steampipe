# Contributing to Steampipe

Because Open Source plays a major part in how we build our products,
we see it as a matter of course to give the same effort back to our
community by creating extensible and easy-to-use software.

We welcome contributions from the community and have created some 
resources to help you get started extending Steampipe:
