# Contributing to Steampipe

Because Open Source plays a major part in how we build our products,
we see it as a matter of course to give the same effort back to our
community by creating extensible and easy-to-use software.

We welcome contributions from the community and have created some 
resources to help you get started extending Steampipe:

## Contributor license agreement

To safeguard the legal integrity of our projects and facilitate their sustainable growth, we require a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://turbot.com/legal/cla) for contributions to `turbot/steampipe`, `turbot/steampipe-docs`, and `turbot/pipe-fittings`. The `turbot/steampipe-plugin-*`, `turbot/steampipe-mod-*`, `turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk`, `steampipe-postgres-fdw`, `steampipe-sqlite`, and `steampipe-export` repos do not require a CLA.
