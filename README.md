## select * from cloud;

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is **the zero-ETL way** to query APIs and services. Use it to expose data sources to SQL.

**SQL**. It's been the data access standard for decades.

**Live data**. Query APIs in real-time.

**Speed**. Query APIs faster than you ever thought possible.

**Concurrency**. Query many data sources in parallel.

**Single binary**. Use it locally, deploy it in CI/CD pipelines.

## Demo time!

## Documentation

See the [documentation](https://steampipe.io/docs) for:

- [Running queries](https://steampipe.io/docs/query/overview)
- [Managing Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/overview)
- [CLI commands](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/overview)
- [Integrations](https://steampipe.io/docs/integrations/overview)
- [Developing plugins](https://steampipe.io/docs/develop/overview)

## Install Steampipe

Install Steampipe from the [downloads](https://steampipe.io/downloads) page:

```sh
# MacOS
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
```

```
# Linux or Windows (WSL2)
sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://steampipe.io/install/steampipe.sh)"
```

Install a plugin for your favorite service (e.g. [AWS](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws), [Azure](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azure), [GCP](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/gcp), [GitHub](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github), [Kubernetes](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes), [Hacker News](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/hackernews), etc):

```sh
steampipe plugin install hackernews
```

Query!

```sh
steampipe query
> select * from hackernews_new limit 10
```

## Steampipe plugins

The Steampipe community has grown a suite of [plugins](https://hub.powerpipe.io/plugins) that map APIs to database tables. Plugins are available for [AWS](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws), [Azure](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/azure), [GCP](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/gcp), [Kubernetes](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes), [GitHub](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github), [Microsoft 365](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/microsoft365), [Salesforce](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/salesforce), and many more.

There are more than 2000 tables in all, each clearly documented with copy/paste/run examples.

## Steampipe distributions

Plugins are available in these distributions.

**Steampipe CLI**. Run [queries](https://steampipe.io/docs/query/overview) that translate APIs to tables in the Postgres instance that's bundled with Steampipe.

**Steampipe Postgres FDWs**. Use [native Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers](https://steampipe.io/docs/steampipe_postgres/overview) to translate APIs to foreign tables.

**Steampipe SQLite extensions**. Use [SQLite extensions](https://steampipe.io/docs/steampipe_sqlite/overview) to translate APIS to SQLite virtual tables.

**Steampipe export tools**. Use [standalone binaries](https://steampipe.io/docs/steampipe_export/overview) that export data from APIs, no database required.

**Turbot Pipes**. Use [Turbot Pipes](https://turbot.com/pipes) to run Steampipe in the cloud.

## Developing

If you want to help develop the core Steampipe binary, these are the steps to build it.

<details>
<summary>Clone</summary>

```sh
git clone git@github.com:turbot/steampipe
```
</details>

<details>
