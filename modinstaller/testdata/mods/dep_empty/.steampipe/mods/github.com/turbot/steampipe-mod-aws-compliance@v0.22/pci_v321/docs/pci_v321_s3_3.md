## Description

This control checks whether S3 buckets have cross-region replication enabled.

PCI DSS does not require data replication or highly available configurations. However, this check aligns with AWS best practices for this control.

In addition to availability, you should consider other systems hardening settings.

## Remediation

1. Open the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Choose the S3 bucket that does not have cross-region replication enabled.
3. Choose **Management**, then choose **Replication**.
4. Choose **Add rule**. If versioning is not already enabled, you are prompted to enable it.
5. Choose your source bucket - `Entire bucket`.
6. Choose your destination bucket. If versioning is not already enabled on the destination bucket for your account, you are prompted to enable it.
7. Choose an IAM role. For more information on setting up permissions for replication, see the [Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/setting-repl-config-perm-overview.html).
8. Enter a rule name, choose **Enabled** for the status, then choose **Next**.
9. Choose **Save**
