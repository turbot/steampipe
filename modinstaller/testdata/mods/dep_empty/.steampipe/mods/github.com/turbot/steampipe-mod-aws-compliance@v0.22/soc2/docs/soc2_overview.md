System and Organization Controls (SOC), defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([AICPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants)), is the name of a suite of reports produced during an audit. It's intended for use by service organizations (organizations that provide information systems as a service to other organizations) to issue validated reports of [internal controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control) over those information systems to the users of those services. The reports focus on controls grouped into five categories known as Trust Service Principles.
