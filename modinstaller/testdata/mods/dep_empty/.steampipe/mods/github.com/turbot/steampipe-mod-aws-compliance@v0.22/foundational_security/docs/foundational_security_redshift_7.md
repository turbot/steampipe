## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon Redshift cluster has EnhancedVpcRouting enabled.

Enhanced VPC routing forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between the cluster and data repositories to go through your VPC. You can then use VPC features such as security groups and network access control lists to secure network traffic. You can also use VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic.

## Remediation

For detailed remediation instructions, see [Enabling enhanced VPC routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-enabling-cluster.html).
