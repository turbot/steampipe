## Description

This control checks whether Amazon Aurora clusters have backtracking enabled.

Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident. They also strengthens the resilience of your systems. Aurora backtracking reduces the time to recover a database to a point in time. It does not require a database restore to do so.

## Remediation

For detailed instructions to enable Aurora backtracking, see [Configuring backtrack with the console when modifying a DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.html#AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring).
