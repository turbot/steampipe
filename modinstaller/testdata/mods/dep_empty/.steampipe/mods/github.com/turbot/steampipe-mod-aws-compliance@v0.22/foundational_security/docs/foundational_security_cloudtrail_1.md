## Description

his control checks that there is at least one multi-Region CloudTrail trail.

AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the following information.

- Identity of the API caller
- Time of the API call
- Source IP address of the API caller
- Request parameters
- Response elements returned by the AWS service

CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made from the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools. The history also includes API calls from higher-level AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation.

- The AWS API call history produced by CloudTrail enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. Multi-Region trails also provide the following benefits.
- A multi-Region trail helps to detect unexpected activity occurring in otherwise unused Regions.
- A multi-Region trail ensures that global service event logging is enabled for a trail by default. Global service event logging records events generated by AWS global services.
- For a multi-Region trail, management events for all read and write operations ensure that CloudTrail records management operations on all of an AWS accountâ€™s resources.

By default, CloudTrail trails that are created using the AWS Management Console are multi-Region trails.

## Remediation
