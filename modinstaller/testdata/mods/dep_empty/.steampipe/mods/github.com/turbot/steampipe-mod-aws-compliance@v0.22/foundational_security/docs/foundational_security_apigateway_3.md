## Description

This control checks whether AWS X-Ray active tracing is enabled for your Amazon API Gateway REST API stages.

X-Ray active tracing enables a more rapid response to performance changes in the underlying infrastructure. Changes in performance could result in a lack of availability of the API. X-Ray active tracing provides real-time metrics of user requests that flow through your API Gateway REST API operations and connected services.

## Remediation
