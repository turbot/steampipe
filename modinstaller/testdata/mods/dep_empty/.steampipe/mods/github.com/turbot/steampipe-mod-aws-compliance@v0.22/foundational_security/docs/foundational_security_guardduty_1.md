## Description

This control checks whether Amazon GuardDuty is enabled in your AWS account and Region.

While GuardDuty can be effective against attacks that an intrusion detection system would typically protect, it might not be a complete solution for every environment. This rule also does not check for the generation of alerts to personnel. For more information about GuardDuty, see the [Amazon GuardDuty User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html).
