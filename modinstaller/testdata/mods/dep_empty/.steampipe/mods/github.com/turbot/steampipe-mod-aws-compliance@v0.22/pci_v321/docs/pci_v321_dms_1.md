## Description

This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public. To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field.

A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network, and the network is connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.

You should also ensure that access to your AWS DMS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users. To do this, restrict usersâ€™ IAM permissions to modify AWS DMS settings and resources.

## Remediation

**Note** that you cannot change the public access setting once a replication instance is created. It must be deleted and recreated.

To configure the AWS DMS replication instances setting to be not publicly accessible

1. Open the [AWS Database Migration Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/).
2. In the left navigation pane, under `Resource management`, navigate to `Replication instances`.
3. To delete the public instance, select the check box for the instance, choose **Actions**, then choose **delete**.
4. Choose Create replication instance. Provide the configuration details.
5. To disable public access, make sure that Publicly accessible is not selected.
6. Choose **Create**.

For more information, see the section on [Creating a replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.html#CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Creating) in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
