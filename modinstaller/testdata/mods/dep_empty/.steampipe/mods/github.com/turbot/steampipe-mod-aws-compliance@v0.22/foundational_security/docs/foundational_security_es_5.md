## Description

This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains have audit logging enabled. This control fails if an Elasticsearch domain does not have audit logging enabled.

Audit logs are highly customizable. They allow you to track user activity on your Elasticsearch clusters, including authentication successes and failures, requests to OpenSearch, index changes, and incoming search queries.

## Remediation

For detailed instructions on enabling audit logs, see [Enabling audit logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/audit-logs.html#audit-log-enabling) in the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.
