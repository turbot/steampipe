## Overview

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to
encourage and enhance cardholder data security and facilitate the broad
adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a
baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect account
data. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card
processing—including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service
providers. PCI DSS also applies to all other entities that store, process or
transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD).
Below is a high-level overview of the 12 PCI DSS requirements.
