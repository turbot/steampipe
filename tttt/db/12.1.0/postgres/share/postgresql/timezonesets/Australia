# The abbreviations set up by this file are no longer in widespread use,
# and should be avoided when possible.  Use this file if you need backwards
# compatibility with old applications or data.

# In order to use this file, you need to set the run-time parameter
# timezone_abbreviations to 'Australia'.  See the `Date/Time Support'
#   appendix in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information.
