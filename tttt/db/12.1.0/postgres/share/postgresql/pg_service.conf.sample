#	Connection configuration file
#
# A service is a set of named connection parameters.  You may specify
# multiple services in this file.  Each starts with a service name in
# brackets.  Subsequent lines have connection configuration parameters of
# the pattern "param=value" or LDAP URLs starting with "ldap://"
# to look up such parameters.  A sample configuration for postgres is
# included in this file.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# Copy this to your sysconf directory (typically /usr/local/pgsql/etc) and
# rename it pg_service.conf.
