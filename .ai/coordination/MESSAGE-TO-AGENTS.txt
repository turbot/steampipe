URGENT MESSAGE TO ALL WAVE 2 AGENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COPY-PASTE THIS TO EACH RUNNING AGENT:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Coverage targets in your task file are WRONG.

Please read: .ai/coordination/WAVE-2-QUALITY-OVERRIDE.md

KEY CHANGES:
- IGNORE coverage % targets (70%, 60%, etc.)
- Focus on finding bugs, not hitting coverage numbers
- Delete any low-value tests you've written
- Success = bugs found, not coverage achieved

UPDATED SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Find at least 1 bug in your domain
✅ Zero low-value tests (no empty functions, trivial getters, constants)
✅ All tests must be HIGH value (complex logic, error paths, edge cases)
✅ Test value score > 2.0
✅ Coverage is tracked but NOT a goal

RATIONALE:
Wave 1.5 proved: 30% coverage with quality tests > 70% coverage with mixed quality.
We deleted 30% of tests and found 4 bugs. Quality > Coverage.

Please audit your work so far and delete any tests that:
- Test empty functions or trivial getters
- Just check "doesn't panic"
- Test constants or hardcoded strings
- Use fake test doubles that always succeed

Better to have 50 high-value tests than 200 mixed-quality tests.

Continue with bug hunting focus!
